# About the Code

Frontend made with Angular and TypeScript, which communicates with the backend made with Java Spring. This backend communicates with the API: [OpenWeather](openweathermap.org)  
It doesn't make to much sense to use Java Spring, since we could make the API calls from Angular, but I want to learn Java Spring so :/
